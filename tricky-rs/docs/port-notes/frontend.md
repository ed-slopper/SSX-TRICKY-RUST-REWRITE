# World Circuit and unlocks: how the original works

Part of the port notes (index: [README.md](README.md)); units and wording as described there.

## World Circuit (`Circuit_*` 0x16b000–0x16d400)

- Each race is heat 1, heat 2, final (6 riders each); 1st–3rd go through, 4th+ ends the event; AI riders
  finishing 4th–6th are out for the event. Medal = place in the final (show-off: by score).
- Points 15/10/5 per medal, paid as the improvement on that track and event; 240 in all fills every attribute
  bar (cap − start sums to 237–240 per character). Rank thresholds 0, 5, 20, 35, 60, 90, 120, 160, 200, 240 (Master);
  boards unlock at the same thresholds (the 999 board from the trick book). Each gold unlocks the next character
  (order 3, 4, 7, 0, 10, 5, 6, 1, 11, 8, 9, 2). A medal on a track unlocks the next in order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 5, 11.
- Computer riders gain a quarter of the player's points as attribute points (f = min(1, 0.25·pts/(100 − base))).

## Unlocks (`Profile_ResetNewGame` 0x161b40, `Circuit_ProcessUnlocks` 0x16c420)

- New game: tracks Garibaldi, Snowdream, Elysium (and the tutorial) open (0x407); riders Mac, Moby, Elise, Eddie.
  Each improved gold opens the next rider: Brodi, Zoe, JP, Kaori, Marisol, Psymon, Seeiah, Luther.
- A medal on track k of the order Garibaldi, Snowdream, Elysium, Mesablanca, Merqury, Megaplex, Aloha, Alaska
  opens the next; a race medal on Alaska opens Untracked, a show-off medal there Pipedream.
- Outfits: 7 per rider; 1–5 from trick book chapters 1–5, 6 at Master. The trick book (6 × 5 tricks) is in
  data/tutorial/trickdef.dat (28-byte records); finishing it gives the UBERBOARD (999).
- Cheat (hold the two shoulder buttons in mask 0x600, then 12 presses): X ▲ → ● ■ ↓ ▲ ■ ← ● X ↑ unlocks everything.
